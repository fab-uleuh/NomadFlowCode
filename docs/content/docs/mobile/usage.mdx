## Screen flow

The app follows a drill-down navigation pattern:

```
Servers → Repos → Features → Terminal
```

### Servers

The home screen lists your configured servers. Each server shows its name, URL, and connection status. Tap a server to connect and view its repositories.

### Repositories

Lists all git repositories managed by the server (cloned into `~/.nomadflowcode/repos/`). From here you can:
- Tap a repo to view its features
- Clone a new repository

### Features

Shows all feature branches (worktrees) for the selected repository. Each feature displays:
- Branch name
- Active status (currently selected tmux window)
- Main branch indicator

Actions:
- **Tap a feature** — switch to it (selects the tmux window) and open the terminal
- **Create feature** — enter a name and base branch to create a new worktree

### Terminal

A full terminal session powered by ttyd, displayed in a WebView. The terminal connects to the tmux window for the selected feature.

## Terminal controls

### Zoom

Pinch to zoom in/out on the terminal view.

### Keyboard shortcuts

The terminal supports standard keyboard input. On iOS, you can use an external keyboard for full key support including modifier keys.

### Tmux shortcuts

Since each feature runs in a tmux window, standard tmux key bindings work:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl-b d` | Detach from session |
| `Ctrl-b n` | Next window |
| `Ctrl-b p` | Previous window |
| `Ctrl-b c` | Create new window |
| `Ctrl-b ,` | Rename window |
| `Ctrl-b [` | Enter copy mode (scroll) |

## Settings

The app stores server configurations locally. You can:
- Edit server details (name, URL, token)
- Remove a server
- Reorder the server list
