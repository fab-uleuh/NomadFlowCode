title: Mobile App Setup
description: Install and configure the NomadFlowCode mobile app.
---

The NomadFlowCode mobile app is built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and React Native. It connects to your NomadFlowCode server to manage repos, features, and terminal sessions.

## Tech stack

- **Expo SDK** with Expo Router (file-based routing)
- **React Native** with New Architecture
- **WebView** for terminal display (loads ttyd)

## Installation

### Development build

```bash
cd nomadflowcode
npm install    # or pnpm install
npx expo run:ios
# or
npx expo run:android
```

### Expo Go (limited)

The app uses native WebView features that may not be fully supported in Expo Go. A development build is recommended.

## Adding a server

1. Open the app and tap **Add Server** (or the `+` button).
2. Enter the server details:
   - **Name** — a friendly label (e.g. "Home Server")
   - **API URL** — your server's address and port (e.g. `http://192.168.1.100:8080`)
   - **Auth Token** — the `auth.secret` from your server's `config.toml`
3. The app derives the ttyd URL automatically from the API URL (port 7681).
4. Tap **Save**. The app will test the connection via the `/health` endpoint.

## Connection

The app communicates with the server over:
- **HTTP** — REST API calls to `/api/*` endpoints with Bearer token auth
- **Direct HTTP** — ttyd HTML page loaded directly on port 7681
- **WebSocket** — terminal data via `/terminal/ws?token=<secret>` (proxied through the API server for iOS compatibility)

Server configuration is stored locally on the device and persists across app restarts.
