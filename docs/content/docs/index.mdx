---

NomadFlowCode is an open-source tool that lets you manage **git worktrees** and **tmux sessions** from a mobile app. It ships as a single Rust binary that runs on your development server, paired with a React Native app for on-the-go access.

## How it works

1. **Server** — The `nomadflow` binary starts an HTTP API server, a tmux session, and a [ttyd](https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd) process on your dev machine.
2. **Mobile app** — The Expo/React Native app connects to your server, lets you browse repos, create/switch feature branches (as git worktrees), and open a full terminal.
3. **Worktrees + tmux** — Each feature branch gets its own worktree directory and a dedicated tmux window. Switching features is instant — no stashing, no context loss.

## Key features

- **Single binary** — server, WebSocket proxy, and TUI wizard in one `nomadflow` executable.
- **Git worktrees** — isolated working directories per feature branch.
- **Tmux integration** — one tmux window per feature, automatic session management.
- **Mobile terminal** — full terminal access via ttyd, with WebSocket proxy for iOS compatibility.
- **Bearer token auth** — simple shared-secret authentication for the API and terminal.
