title: Getting Started
description: Install NomadFlowCode and run your first session.
---

## Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed on your development server:

- **Git** (2.20+) — with worktree support
- **tmux** (3.0+) — terminal multiplexer
- **ttyd** (1.7+) — share your terminal over the web
- **Rust toolchain** — to build from source (or download a prebuilt binary)

## Installation

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fab-uleuh/NomadFlowCode.git
cd NomadFlowCode/nomadflow-rs
cargo build --release
```

The binary is at `target/release/nomadflow`. Copy it somewhere in your `$PATH`:

```bash
cp target/release/nomadflow ~/.local/bin/
```

## Quick start

### 1. Create a config (optional)

NomadFlowCode works with sensible defaults. To customize, create `~/.nomadflowcode/config.toml`:

```toml
[paths]
base_dir = "~/.nomadflowcode"

[tmux]
session = "nomadflow"

[ttyd]
port = 7681

[api]
port = 8080
host = "0.0.0.0"

[auth]
secret = "your-secret-token"
```

### 2. Start the server

```bash
# Default mode: starts the server + TUI wizard
nomadflow

# Server-only mode (headless/Docker)
nomadflow serve
```

### 3. Connect from your phone

1. Install the NomadFlowCode app (Expo dev build or standalone).
2. Tap **Add Server**.
3. Enter your server's URL (e.g. `http://192.168.1.100:8080`) and the auth token.
4. Browse your repos, create features, and open the terminal.
