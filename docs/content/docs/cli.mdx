The `nomadflow` binary provides several modes of operation.

## Usage

```bash
nomadflow [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]
```

## Commands

### Default (no command)

```bash
nomadflow
```

Starts the HTTP server in the background, then launches the **TUI wizard**. When the TUI exits, the server is stopped. If the TUI returns a tmux session to attach to, `tmux attach-session` is executed automatically.

### `serve`

```bash
nomadflow serve
```

Runs the HTTP server in the foreground with full tracing/logging enabled. Use this for headless deployments, Docker containers, or systemd services.

## Options

### `--status`

```bash
nomadflow --status
```

Displays the current tmux session status and exits. Shows whether the managed tmux session exists and its windows.

### `--attach <feature>`

```bash
nomadflow --attach my-feature
```

Starts the server briefly, then attaches directly to the tmux session. Useful for quickly jumping into a running session from the command line.

## TUI wizard

When running in default mode, the TUI provides an interactive terminal interface with the following screens:

- **Server list** — manage remote server connections
- **Add server** — multi-step form: name, URL, token, confirmation
- **Repository browser** — list and select repos
- **Feature browser** — list, create, and switch feature branches

The TUI is built with [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs) and exits cleanly, handing off to `tmux attach` if a session was selected.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `RUST_LOG` | Controls log verbosity (e.g. `nomadflow_server=debug,tower_http=info`). Only effective in `serve` mode — TUI mode suppresses logs to avoid corrupting the terminal display. |

## Configuration

The CLI reads `~/.nomadflowcode/config.toml` on startup. See [Configuration](/docs/server/configuration) for the full reference.
