# Minimal Template

This is a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) project built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/) and [React Native Reusables](https://reactnativereusables.com).

It was initialized using the following command:

```bash
npx @react-native-reusables/cli@latest init -t nomadflowcode
```

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
```

This will start the Expo Dev Server. Open the app in:

- **iOS**: press `i` to launch in the iOS simulator _(Mac only)_
- **Android**: press `a` to launch in the Android emulator
- **Web**: press `w` to run in a browser

You can also scan the QR code using the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app on your device. This project fully supports running in Expo Go for quick testing on physical devices.

## Adding components

You can add more reusable components using the CLI:

```bash
npx react-native-reusables/cli@latest add [...components]
```

> e.g. `npx react-native-reusables/cli@latest add input textarea`

If you don't specify any component names, you'll be prompted to select which components to add interactively. Use the `--all` flag to install all available components at once.

## OTA Updates (EAS Update)

The app uses [EAS Update](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/introduction/) to push JS/asset updates without going through the stores.

Update checks run automatically on app launch (skipped in dev mode).

### Publish an update

```bash
# Preview
eas update --channel preview --message "description"

# Production
eas update --channel production --message "description"
```

### Build profiles

| Profile       | Channel       | Distribution |
|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| `development` | `development` | `internal`   |
| `preview`     | `preview`     | `internal`   |
| `production`  | `production`  | store        |

### Runtime version

Uses the `appVersion` policy: each store version (`app.json` > `version`) gets its own OTA update channel.

## Deploy with EAS

The easiest way to deploy your app is with [Expo Application Services (EAS)](https://expo.dev/eas).

- [EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/)
- [EAS Updates](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/introduction/)
- [EAS Submit](https://docs.expo.dev/submit/introduction/)
